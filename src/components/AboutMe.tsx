          Hi, I'm Daniel Prem Kumar Golconda, a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Web Services with a passion for building AI-powered, 
          scalable applications using AWS, React, and modern cloud technologies. I enjoy turning complex 
          business problems into reliable, user-friendly solutions that deliver real value.

        <Typography variant="body1">
          I've led multiple initiatives across education and supply chain domainsâ€”owning projects end-to-end 
          from system design and architecture to development and deployment. I've built full-stack solutions 
          using React, TypeScript, GraphQL, and Node.js, and deployed them with AWS services like Lambda, 
          API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Bedrock. My work with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector 
          search has enabled teams to automate insights and make faster, data-informed decisions.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="body1">
          In addition to hands-on development, I take an active role in mentoring junior engineers, leading 
          technical design reviews, and helping shape team-wide engineering practices. I focus on building 
          systems that are scalable, maintainable, and designed to grow alongside the product and team.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{

          Outside of work, I enjoy playing the guitar and spending time with my golden retriever, 
          Toastie. Whether it's strumming a new tune or chasing him 
          around the park, those little moments help me recharge and stay creative.
